</text></title><p><text><SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The co-transcriptional packaging of nascent RNA transcripts into <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="0" ids="Q96LT9">RNP</z:uniprot> complexes is important for transcription, RNA processing, and RNA export from the nucleus [1]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain><z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="0" ids="Q96LT9">RNP</z:uniprot> complexes are composed of multiple protein and RNA subunits. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>They are heterogeneous and dynamic, differing in composition depending on the transcript and the stage of the transcript’s life cycle. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Potential combinatorial permutations are vast enough to facilitate unique <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="0" ids="Q96LT9">RNP</z:uniprot> processing pathways for different subsets of transcripts [2]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>These observations have inspired the hypothesis that co- and post-transcriptional <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="0" ids="Q96LT9">RNP</z:uniprot> mediated mechanisms support the elaboration of coordinated gene expression [3], [4]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Loss of <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="0" ids="Q96LT9">RNP</z:uniprot> function can also compromise genome integrity directly by inducing promiscuous formation of R-loops, a three-strand nucleic acid structure composed of an RNA∶DNA hybrid formed during transcription plus a displaced DNA strand [5]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>R-loops lead to DNA strand breaks by multiple mechanisms. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>While the importance of <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="0" ids="Q96LT9">RNP</z:uniprot> mediated mechanisms for gene expression and genome integrity is increasingly appreciated, the contribution of individual <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="0" ids="Q96LT9">RNP</z:uniprot> complexes to normal growth and development in mammals is not well characterized. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Identifying these contributions will further the understanding of how defects in <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="0" ids="Q96LT9">RNP</z:uniprot> mediated processes lead to disease [6]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>THO is an <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="0" ids="Q96LT9">RNP</z:uniprot> complex that assembles on nascent RNA in a RNA cap, splicing, and ATP-dependent manner [7], [8]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>It recruits RNA export factors to form larger complexes like TREX that facilitate interaction with and activation of the nuclear export apparatus [9]–[11]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>THO, therefore, physically links transcription with nuclear export [12]–[16]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>In addition to defects in nuclear export, THO deficiency affects other steps in transcription that depend on proper <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="0" ids="Q96LT9">RNP</z:uniprot> biogenesis including transcriptional elongation [17]–[19], transcription-associated recombination [20]–[22], and transcript 3′ end formation [23]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>The yeast THO orthologue contains four proteins encoded by the <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="0" ids="P53552,F4IAT2">THO2</z:uniprot>, <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="0" ids="Q9C9W5">HPR1</z:uniprot>, <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="0" ids="Q656A5,P33441">MFT1</z:uniprot>, and <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="0" ids="O13539">THP2</z:uniprot> genes [12]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Since THO is required for early embryonic development, testing the requirements for THO in maintaining homeostasis in adult tissues has been limited. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>To overcome this limitation, a floxed mouse allele has been generated allowing inducible deletion of the <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="5" ids="Q8R3N6,P59924">Thoc1</z:uniprot> [26]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Using this allele, widespread <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="5" ids="Q8R3N6,P59924">Thoc1</z:uniprot> deletion has been observed to cause cell type specific effects such as disruption of stem cell homeostasis in small intestine but not the related mucosa of the large intestine [27]. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="255" pm="."><plain>This difference may be explained by the distinct expression pattern of Cre transgenes used in the studies, the known side-effects of <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="139" ids="P51527,P51526">interferon</z:uniprot> treatment on hematopoiesis, the time course of the experiments, or distinct functions for the <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="5" ids="Q8R3N6,P59924">Thoc1</z:uniprot> and <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="0" ids="Q6NY52,Q9W1F4,Q28DG8">Thoc5</z:uniprot> encoded proteins. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="256" pm="."><plain>This latter possibility seems unlikely in light of the observation that <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="0" ids="Q6NY52,Q9W1F4,Q28DG8">Thoc5</z:uniprot> protein levels decline in <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="5" ids="Q8R3N6,P59924">Thoc1</z:uniprot> knockout tissue and vice versa [25]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="257" pm="."><plain>This suggests that THO complex subunits become unstable when the complex does not assemble normally [34]. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="258" pm="."><plain>Lineage dependent effects of THO complex deficiency have now been observed in multiple biological contexts [25], [27], [35], [36]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="259" pm="."><plain>The biological basis for the specificity of these effects is not currently understood. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="260" pm="."><plain>One possible explanation is that the THO complex regulates a subset of transcripts important for the cell types affected. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="261" pm="."><plain>For example, the THO complex may regulate a subset of transcripts uniquely important for the differentiation, proliferation or viability of myeloid cells thus rendering myeloid cells uniquely sensitive to <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="5" ids="Q8R3N6,P59924">Thoc1</z:uniprot> loss. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="262" pm="."><plain>Consistent with this hypothesis, <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="0" ids="Q6NY52,Q9W1F4,Q28DG8">Thoc5</z:uniprot> deficient myeloid cells show defects in the expression of some genes that potentially influence myeloid differentiation [32]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="263" pm="."><plain>Gene expression profiling of other THO deficient cell types has detected changes in different subsets of transcripts [21], [35], [37], [38], suggesting the transcripts regulated by THO vary by cell type. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="264" pm="."><plain>How THO selects transcripts for regulation is unknown, but elucidation of these mechanisms will be required to validate this hypothesis. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="265" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, THO may regulate a large number of gene transcripts in most cells. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="266" pm="."><plain>Chromatin immunoprecipitation data from yeast indicates that the THO complex regulates the transcripts for most actively transcribed genes [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="267" pm="."><plain>If this extends to mammalian cells, <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="5" ids="Q8R3N6,P59924">Thoc1</z:uniprot> deficiency would be expected to cause a general decline in the efficiency of gene expression. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="268" pm="."><plain>In this case, differential effects of THO deficiency on individual transcripts is expected to be modest, as is typically observed [21], [32], [35], [37], [38], and highly expressed genes would likely show the greatest defects [20]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="269" pm="."><plain>Widespread defects in gene transcription may also account for the accumulation of R-loops and DNA damage that is observed in THO deficient cells [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="270" pm="."><plain>In this scenario, cell types that turn over rapidly would be expected to suffer the most from <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="5" ids="Q8R3N6,P59924">Thoc1</z:uniprot> loss. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="271" pm="."><plain>Rapid cell turnover requires high levels of gene expression to meet the demands of cell growth. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="272" pm="."><plain>Further, rapidly proliferating cells replicate their DNA frequently, making them particularly susceptible to DNA damage that is generated when replication forks collide with R-loops [31]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="273" pm="."><plain>Indeed one characteristic shared by the cell types acutely sensitive to <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="5" ids="Q8R3N6,P59924">Thoc1</z:uniprot> loss is their relatively rapid turnover. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="274" pm="."><plain>The epithelium of the small intestine completely turns over every 3–5 days in the mouse [39], while 1×109 neutrophils are produced per kilogram per day in humans [40]. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="275" pm="."><plain>This alternative hypothesis predicts that <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="5" ids="Q8R3N6,P59924">Thoc1</z:uniprot> loss would also affect lymphocytes if examined under conditions like adaptive immunity where transcriptional programs drive robust lymphocyte proliferation and production of effector molecules. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="276" pm="."><plain>More study is required to test these different and mutually exclusive hypotheses. </plain></SENT>
</text></p><p><text><SENT sid="277" pm="."><plain>The role that <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="0" ids="Q96LT9">RNP</z:uniprot> complexes play in supporting coordinated gene expression programs is increasingly appreciated [3], [4], but the requirements for individual complexes in normal development and homeostasis have not been explored extensively. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="278" pm="."><plain>The results described here demonstrate that myeloid progenitor cells have a cell intrinsic requirement for the <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="5" ids="Q8R3N6,P59924">Thoc1</z:uniprot> encoded protein, an essential component of the THO <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="0" ids="Q96LT9">RNP</z:uniprot> complex. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="279" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="5" ids="Q8R3N6,P59924">Thoc1</z:uniprot> deficiency in the hematopoietic system are lineage dependent. </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="281" pm="."><plain>Context dependent effects have also been observed in other tissues like the intestine [27], [33], suggesting this may be a general theme. </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="282" pm="."><plain>Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying these context dependent effects will inform our understanding of how <z:uniprot sup="inside" fb="0" ids="Q96LT9">RNP</z:uniprot> complexes contribute to normal development, tissue homeostasis, and disease. </plain></SENT>
